# Online Banking Management System - Design and Development

## Overview

This project focuses on the creation of a user-friendly and feature-rich online banking management system. The system is designed to provide various functionalities for efficient banking operations. Key features of the project include:

- Storage of account transactional details and customer information in files.
- Implementation of a secure login system for account holders.
- Password-protected administrative access to ensure authorized management system access.
- Creation of three types of logins: normal user, joint account user, and administrator.
- Administrative access allowing administrators to add, delete, modify, and search for specific account details.
- Customer login prompt with menu options such as deposit, withdraw, balance enquiry, password change, view details, and exit.
- Implementation of file locking for joint account holders to ensure data integrity during simultaneous access.
- Utilization of socket programming to enable server-client communication, with the server maintaining the database and serving multiple clients concurrently.
- Emphasis on system calls instead of library functions for process management, file management, file locking, multithreading, and inter-process communication mechanisms.

By developing this online banking management system, the project demonstrates proficiency in various aspects of software development, including secure authentication, data management, concurrent processing, and system-level programming techniques.
